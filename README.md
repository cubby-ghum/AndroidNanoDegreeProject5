Make Your App Material

Execise: In this project, you will update the look and feel of an app to meet Material Design specifications.

- App uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).

- App uses an AppBar and associated Toolbars.

- App provides a Floating Action Button for the most common action(s).

- App properly specifies elevations for app bars, FABs, and other elements specified in the Material Design specification.

- App has a consistent color theme defined in styles.xml. Color theme does not impact usability of the app.

- App uses images that are high quality, specific, and full bleed.

- App uses fonts that are either the Android defaults, are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
